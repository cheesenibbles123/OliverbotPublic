# OliverbotPublic

These are the oliverbot datafile and main js files.

I didnt upload the node-modules file to go with this as it contains too many files to upload in one go, and screw doing it manually.

There are likley lots of malpractises in here and in general don't expect everything to work, some stuff is wip, and upgrading to discordjs v12 fucked with a lot of stuff.
